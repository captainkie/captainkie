# 👋 Hi, I'm a Senior Backend / Fullstack Engineer

Backend-driven engineer with strong experience in **CMS, E-commerce, and system integration**.  
I specialize in building, maintaining, and stabilizing **real-world production systems**, including complex and legacy codebases.

- Integrate multiple platforms and enterprise systems
- Maintain, refactor, and improve **legacy applications**
- Debug and resolve **production issues**
- Deliver end-to-end features (backend + frontend integration)
- Work effectively in **small teams with limited resources**
